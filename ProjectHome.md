A suite of cross-platform applications and libraries for geospatial processing and 3D visualization of terrain.  The main applications are:
  * **VTBuilder:** Loads all your raw data from GIS formats, allows you to process them as needed to prepare them for visualization: resample, reproject, add higher-level descriptions, set attributes, then export to efficient formats.
  * **Enviro:** 3D runtime environment, which allows you to not only visualize but also dynamically interact in many ways (move buildings, plant trees, change time of day, and much more.)
